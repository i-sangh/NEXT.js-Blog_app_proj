**What is Next.js?**
Next.js is a framework that simplifies the process of building React applications. It provides an essential set of features out of the box, including server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and an intuitive API that accelerates development. Additionally, Next.js offers compatibility with React Native, making it an excellent choice for building web and mobile applications with a consistent codebase. According to our latest knowledge update in January 2022, Next.js continues to evolve and push the boundaries of what is possible in web and mobile development.

**Key Features of Next.js:**
Before we explore the latest version, let's recap some of the key features that have contributed to Next.js's popularity:

Server-side Rendering (SSR ): Next.js react allows developers to implement SSR easily, enhancing performance by rendering pages on the server and sending fully-rendered HTML to the client.

**Automatic Code Splitting:**

Next.js automatically splits your code into smaller chunks, optimizing the loading time of your application. This feature is instrumental in creating efficient and fast-loading web pages.
